This project focused on predicting corporate bankruptcy in the Taiwanese stock market from 1999 to 2009. The project employs the CRISP-DM framework, meticulously navigating through six key phases, including data preprocessing techniques like outlier handling and oversampling to address class imbalance. Two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier, were utilized for bankruptcy prediction. While the former displayed high accuracy, it suffered from low recall crucial for identifying bankrupt companies. In contrast, the Gradient Boosting Classifier, with slightly lower accuracy, demonstrated significantly better recall and F1-score, establishing its suitability for the task. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied for dimensionality reduction to improve algorithm efficiency. The project emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms and metrics for imbalanced datasets, focusing on recall, precision, and F1-score. These insights contribute to understanding corporate bankruptcy prediction in the Taiwanese stock market and offer practical guidance for stakeholders in making informed financial decisions and effectively managing risks.
